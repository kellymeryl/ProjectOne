# Project 1
## To Do List Application

This application is a basic To-Do list application.  There are three view controllers on the To-Do list application.

In the first view controller, the user has the ability to enter a list title into a textfield and click add. When the list is added to the table view, the list is stored.  The user can delete this list, or click on the table view cell to add items to the list, which will segue the user to the second view controller.  In the first view controller, there is an error message that appears if the user tries to click the "add" button without entering any text into the textfield.

In the second view controller, the user has the ability to add items and descriptions to the list they created on the first screen.  An error message appears if the user attempts to enter a description without giving the item a title.  When the user clicks the "add" button, the title of the information appears on the view controller below, and the description is stored with that title.  The user can delete the item from the list, or click the item, which will segue the user into the third view controller.

In the third view controller, the title of the item the user added on the second view controller appears in an editable text field located in the navigation bar of the view.  The user can edit this title, and that edit will save.  The user can also edit or add to the description, press done, and the user will be brought back to the first to-do list screen, where all of the changes are saved.
